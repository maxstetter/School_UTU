# Instructions

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!". Write
your code in `main.go`.

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution

If everything goes well, you will be ready for your first real exercise.
