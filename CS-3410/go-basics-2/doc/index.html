<html><head></head><body><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In the previous exercise, we saw that there are two ways to write
comments in Go: single-line comments that are preceded by <code>//</code>, and
multiline comment blocks that are wrapped with <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.</p>

<h2>Documentation comments</h2>

<p>In Go, comments play an important role in documenting code. They are
used by the <code>godoc</code> command, which extracts these comments to create
documentation about Go packages. A documentation comment should be a
complete sentence that starts with the name of the thing being
described and ends with a period.</p>

<p>Comments should precede packages as well as exported identifiers,
for example exported functions, methods, package variables,
constants, and structs, which you will learn more about in the next
exercises.</p>

<p>A package-level variable can look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// TemperatureCelsius represents a certain temperature in degrees Celsius.
var TemperatureCelsius float64
</code></pre>

<h2>Package comments</h2>

<p>Package comments should be written directly before a package clause
(<code>package x</code>) and begin with <code>Package x ...</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Package kelvin provides tools to convert
// temperatures to and from Kelvin.
package kelvin
</code></pre>

<h2>Function comments</h2>

<p>A function comment should be written directly before the function
declaration. It should be a full sentence that starts with the
function name. For example, an exported comment for the function
<code>Calculate</code> should take the form <code>Calculate ...</code>. It should also
explain what arguments the function takes, what it does with them,
and what its return values mean, ending in a period):</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// CelsiusFreezingTemp returns an integer value equal to the
// temperature at which water freezes in degrees Celsius.
func CelsiusFreezingTemp() int {
	return 0
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>Being hired by a big weather forecast company, your job is to
maintain their code base. Scrolling through the code, you find it
hard to follow what the code is actually doing. Good thing you know
just the right thing to do!</p>

<h2>1. Document package weather</h2>

<p>Write a package comment for <code>package weather</code> that describes its
contents. The package comment should introduce the package and
provide information relevant to the package as a whole.</p>

<h2>2. Document the CurrentCondition variable</h2>

<p>Write a comment for the package variable <code>CurrentCondition</code>.</p>

<p>This should tell any user of the package what information the
variable stores, and what they can do with it.</p>

<h2>3. Document the CurrentLocation variable</h2>

<p>Just like the previous step, write a comment for <code>CurrentLocation</code>.</p>

<h2>4. Document the Forecast() function</h2>

<p>Write a function comment for <code>Forecast()</code>. Your comments must
describe what the function does, but not how it does it.</p>
