<p>Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains
raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor
is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no
remainder. The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of
another is to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modulo
operation</a>.</p>

<p>The rules of <code>raindrops</code> are that if a given number:</p>

<ul>
<li>has 3 as a factor, add &#39;Pling&#39; to the result.</li>
<li>has 5 as a factor, add &#39;Plang&#39; to the result.</li>
<li>has 7 as a factor, add &#39;Plong&#39; to the result.</li>
<li><em>does not</em> have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should
be the digits of the number.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li>28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be &#34;Plong&#34;.</li>
<li>30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be &#34;PlingPlang&#34;.</li>
<li>34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be &#34;34&#34;.</li>
</ul>
