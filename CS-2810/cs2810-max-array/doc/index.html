<p>Your function should implement this interface:</p>

<pre><code>int array_max(int *array, int count)
</code></pre>

<p>(all <code>int</code> values mean 64-bit integers)</p>

<p><code>array</code> is the address of an array of 64-bit integers, and
<code>count</code> is the number of entries in the array (so the total memory
used by the array is <code>8 Ã— count</code>).</p>

<p>You may assume that the array contains at least one element. Hint:
start by assuming the first element is the largest, then scan the
rest of the array looking for anything bigger.</p>

<p>Note that this is a leaf function so there is no need to set up a
stack frame. You can do everything using scratch registers.</p>

<p>Write your code in the file <code>array_max.s</code>.</p>
